# Vertex DECI3 Runtime

Vertexdeci3rt is a plugin which allows communications with the Playstation 3 console through TMAPI.

## Installation

You'll require the official PS3 SDK with TMAPI installed in order to build this project since it depends on libraries
provided with it.

Due to legal reasons, Links cannot be provided to the SDK.

It is best to figure it out yourself.
