ADDITIONAL PERMISSION UNDER GNU GPL VERSION 3 SECTION 7
========================================================

Plugin Linking Exception for Vertex

Copyright (C) 2026 Vertex Project Contributors

This file is an additional permission under section 7 of the GNU General
Public License, version 3 ("GPLv3").

Exception Intent
----------------

This exception allows developers to create plugins for Vertex and
distribute those plugins under licenses of their choosing, provided
the plugins interact with Vertex solely through the defined public
API headers located in the include/sdk/ directory.

Grant of Additional Permission
-------------------------------

As a special exception to the terms and conditions of version 3 of the
GNU General Public License (GPL), the copyright holders of Vertex grant
you permission to combine or link Vertex (or a modified version of Vertex)
with independent plugins, and to distribute the resulting combination,
provided that:

1. The independent plugin interacts with Vertex exclusively through the
   public API defined in the header files located in the include/sdk/
   directory of the Vertex source distribution, specifically:

   - api.h
   - debugger.h
   - disassembler.h
   - event.h
   - log.h
   - macro.h
   - memory.h
   - process.h
   - registry.h
   - statuscode.h

2. The independent plugin does not include, link to, or depend upon any
   internal implementation details of Vertex beyond the SDK API headers.

3. The independent plugin is distributed as a separate work and clearly
   identified as an independent plugin for Vertex.

Under this exception, you may distribute such independent plugins under
terms of your choice, so long as:

a) The independent plugin, when distributed separately, does not include
   any code from Vertex except what is necessary to interface with the
   SDK API headers.

b) If you distribute Vertex together with such independent plugins, you
   must still comply with the terms of the GNU GPL version 3 for all
   Vertex code.

c) You provide clear notice to recipients that:
   - Vertex itself is licensed under GNU GPL version 3
   - The independent plugin is under separate licensing terms
   - The combination is provided in accordance with this exception

Clarifications
--------------

This exception does NOT apply to:

- Modifications to Vertex itself (which remain under GPL version 3)
- Plugins that link to or use internal Vertex APIs not in include/sdk/
- Plugins that include copied Vertex implementation code
- Static linking of plugins into the Vertex executable
- Forked or derived versions of Vertex itself

This exception DOES apply to:

- Dynamic library plugins loaded at runtime via the SDK API
- Proprietary or open source plugins using only the SDK API
- Commercial plugins that interact exclusively through include/sdk/
- Closed-source plugins that respect the SDK boundary

Scope of SDK API
----------------

The "SDK API" refers exclusively to the C/C++ interface definitions,
type declarations, constants, and inline functions declared in the
header files located in include/sdk/ of the Vertex source distribution.

Implementation code in Vertex's src/ directories remains under strict
GPL version 3 with no exceptions.

Termination
-----------

If you fail to comply with the conditions of this exception, your rights
under this exception terminate automatically, though your rights under
the base GPL version 3 license (for creating GPL-compatible plugins)
remain intact.

How to Apply This Exception to Your Plugin
-------------------------------------------

To make it clear that your plugin uses this exception, you can include
a notice like this in your plugin's source files:

    This plugin for Vertex is distributed under [YOUR LICENSE].
    It uses only the Vertex SDK API (include/sdk/) and is provided
    under the Additional Permission of the Vertex Plugin Exception.
    Vertex itself remains under GNU GPL version 3.

Questions
---------

If you have questions about this exception or whether your plugin
qualifies, please contact the Vertex project maintainers.
